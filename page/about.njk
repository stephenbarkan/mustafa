title: About Me
elaboration: Hi! I’m Mustafa, a Chicago-based performer, poet, educator, and community organizer.

  Flow entered my life through the festival circuit, but it became meaningful when it followed me home. What started as performance grew into a daily grounding practice, a way to regulate my body, attention, and sense of self. Over time, flow shifted from something I did for others into something I did to stay present and well.

  My work weaves four practices: flow arts, fire performance, poetry, and juggling. Each one trains attention in a different way. Together, they form a practice of presence, regulation, and relational awareness.

  I approach performance as an exchange rather than a display. Whether through movement, flame, rhythm, or language, I aim to create experiences that feel grounded, intentional, and alive to the moment.

  As a queer person of pan-Asian descent and the middle child of immigrants, I draw inspiration from ancestral ways of moving with the elements, especially wind and fire. These practices shape how I relate to movement, community, and care.
