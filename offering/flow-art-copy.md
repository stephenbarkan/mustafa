The prompt was to flow with your non-dominant hand, for me that’s my left. It felt clumsy at first, like trying to doodle a heart with the wrong hand, but balance takes practice. Kinda like my new day job, where I’m still learning rhythm and patience (and yes, I literally recorded this right before work in my recruitment shirt LOL). Just like with my students, the magic is in showing up, wobble and all. The more I lean in, the more the groove finds me.
