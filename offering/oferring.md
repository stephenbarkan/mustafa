Embodied performance rooted in presence, rhythm, and attention. Live offerings shaped by flow arts, fire performance, music, and dance.

Engagement suitable for rising musicians, artists, and community organizers, adaptable for: anniversary parties, birthday parties, community events, concerts, corporate parties, cultural celebrations, festivals, fundraisers, pop ups, private parties, and weddings.

## Practice and Philosophy

LED-based flow and movement rooted in rhythm, breath, and spatial awareness. Performed with care for pacing, safety, and the energy of the space. Intentional fire flow for outdoor events, festivals, and gatherings where safety, respect, and presence are central.

Flow is approached as an ongoing practice of regulation and listening, not just an outcome or visual effect.

Fire is approached as a living element and a teacher, requiring respect, accountability, and presence.
