Just like with my students, the magic is in showing up, wobble and all. The more I lean in, the more the groove finds me.</p><h2>Community resources</h2><ul><li><a href="@flowspace_chicago">@flowspace_chicago</a></li><li><a href="flow-town.net">flow-town.net</a></li><li><a href="haus-of-flow.com">haus-of-flow.com</a></li></ul><h2>My gear</h2><p>The prompt was to flow with your non-dominant hand, for me that’s my left.
