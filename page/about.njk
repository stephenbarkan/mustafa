title: About Me!
elaboration: Hi! I’m Mustafa, a Chicago-based performer, poet, educator, and community organizer.
bodyContent: Flow entered my life through the festival circuit, but it became meaningful when it followed me home. What started as performance grew into a daily grounding practice, a way to regulate my body, attention, and sense of self. Over time, flow shifted from something I did for others into something I did to stay present and well.
